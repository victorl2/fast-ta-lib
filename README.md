# FastTA lib
A concise and fast technical analysis library.

## About the library
FastTA lib is a library created with modern cpp standards in mind, it is provided via header files `.hpp` without any external dependency as a requirement.

## Running tests
+ You must have a c++ compiler installed, is this example we will use [`g++`](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/compiling-with-g-plus-plus/)
+ Inside the *fast-ta-lib* folder compile the code with `g++ src/indicators_test.cpp`
+ Run the tests with `./a.out`

If you see the message *All tests passed* everything is working properly.
